# Install the local commit-msg hook so `git commit` is linted by
# conventionalcommit/commitlint before the commit is created. Requires Go
# 1.25+ on PATH. Pinned to v0.12.0 (the version audited against
# .commitlint.yaml); bump deliberately and re-run the audit.
#
# Side effect: `commitlint init` sets `core.hooksPath` to
# `.commitlint/hooks`, so any hooks already in `.git/hooks/` (pre-commit,
# pre-push, ...) stop running until you copy them under
# `.commitlint/hooks/` or unset `core.hooksPath`.
