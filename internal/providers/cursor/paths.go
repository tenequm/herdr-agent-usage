/**
 * Cursor state-directory resolution.
 *
 * This location is shared between two processes that do not share an
 * environment: the statusLine bridge runs inside the Cursor process, while the
 * provider runs in a process Herdr spawns later. Anything Cursor was launched
 * with — CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR in particular — is visible only to the writer, so
 * deriving the path from it would file snapshots where the reader never looks.
 *
 * The default therefore depends on nothing but the home directory, matching how
 * notify state resolves for Claude (internal/ratelimit) and for the same
 * reason. USAGEBAR_STATE_DIR stays available as the deliberate, user-global
 * override that both processes can be given.
 *
 * Cursor's own config may still live elsewhere; setup reports the documented
 * locations for that, but plugin-derived state does not follow it.
