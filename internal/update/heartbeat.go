/**
 * Tracks whether the Agent Usage pane is currently collecting so the idle
 * watcher can back off instead of running a second clock.
 *
 * A bare timestamp is not enough: if the Agent Usage pane process keeps
 * running across a `go build` without being restarted, it keeps ticking a
 * fresh-looking heartbeat using whatever publish logic it was compiled
 * with — even if that build predates the $cache_* and $limit publish calls entirely.
 * The watcher would then see "recently collected" forever and permanently
 * skip its own periodic publish, leaving sidebar tokens frozen. Tagging the
 * heartbeat with the writer's own build fingerprint lets a reader on a
 * different build refuse to trust it, timestamp notwithstanding.
